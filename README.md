# This project services to aid a real estate investor. 
Using AI in real estate can provide insights and faster analytics into properties listed under their book value. 

- Predictive Analytics: Machine learning(ML) algorithms can analyze historical data to predict future property values based on previous market trends. This help investors make informed and data driven decisions in regards to buying, leasing, or selling properties that are on the market today. 

- Identify Opportunities: ML can go through large datasets to identify opportunities and assess potential risks associated after acquisition. Features into a property such as location, renovation dates, age of buildings, number of rooms/bathrooms, square feet, lot size, and property condition, service as prossible indicators for future investments. 

- Decision-Making: ML can automate complex tasks that take up a professional valuable time, like assessing spreadsheet data, calculating return on investment prospects, allowing investors to take on more opportunities. Despite the results that ML can provide, it is important to review AI's output. The algorithm is not the all-in-one solutions for real estate investing.  

- Identify Overlooked Features: AI-powered algorithms can identify and target demographics that can be drivers in valuation. Such as a waterfront property by a lake or a downtown condos with a view.

Because of a couple of outliers with in the correlation, ML models can experience difficulties in predictions.
